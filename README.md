# Sorting Suite
Module 4 | 2019.11.21

## About
This project is a challenge to implement one of the four following fundamental algorithms: bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, or quick sort.

The goal is to practice testing & writing JavaScript.

## Expectations
[X] Choose **one** of the fundamental sorting algorithms to complete

[X] Use Node.js to run your code

[X] Use Mocha/Chai to run your tests

## Getting Started
This project uses Node.js, which can be downloaded [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Perform the following in the CLI to run the program:
`$ node bubble-sort.js`

## Testing
[Mocha](https://mochajs.org/), a JavaScript test framework, runs this project's test suite. Mocha can be installed via the CLI: `$ npm install mocha -g`. This project's test suite also requires [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/), a JavaScript assertion library, which has been installed via the CLI (`$ npm install chai`).

Perform the following in the CLI to run the test suite:
`$ mocha test`
